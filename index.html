	My name is Scott Hunter and I'm orginally from New Orleans. I have had several careers over the last 15 years. I have been a televison news reporter, owned a cupcake shop ,as well as, a beauty business. My latest venture is as a software developer. My interest in web development arose from my love of creating. Since I was a kid I have always created things. In my adult life I've shaped stories as a reporter later creating brands and products online and in brick and mortar enviorment.
